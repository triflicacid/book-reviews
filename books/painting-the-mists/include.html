<h1>Progression</h1>

<h2>Qi Cultivation</h2>
Realms are divided into Early, Middle, Late and Peak.
<ul>
    <li><strong>Qi Condensation</strong> - Some humans are talented in harvesting the ambient energies of heaven and earth. They cultivate qi, enabling them to
    perform fierce magics by bending the elements themselves. Angelic cultivators gravitate toward this powerful but complex
    path.</li>
    <li><strong>Foundation Establishment</strong> - After forming a sufficiently large qi pool, cultivators solidify it into solid pillars known as a foundation. Their
    foundation grows from the bottom of their Dantian and eventually grows tall enough to reach the top. Their qi thickens,
    and the amount of thickened qi they control depends on the height of their foundation. Foundation-establishment
    cultivators can fly a short distance from the ground using treasures like flying swords or special boots.</li>
    <li><strong>Core Formation</strong> - When their pillars reach their maximum height, cultivators melt them into a core, the most efficient way to store qi. Qi
    now takes the form of a fluid that travels in and out of their core. The core grows until it reaches its maximum size.
    At this point, cultivators are able to use their potent qi to fly unaided.</li>
    <li><strong>Rune Carving</strong> - Carve your core with runes of enlightenment. Form a base with which to gain enlightenment on the Dao. Transcendent
    cultivators gain a domain, which lets them mobilize heaven and earth energy. Opposing domains compete for energy, and
    the battle depends on the strength and concepts of each cultivator.</li>
    <li><strong>Rune Gathering</strong> - Gather the power of law runes and enforce your will upon the world. From now on, the Dao is everything - the strength of
    a cultivator's runes varies greatly. Rune Gathering cultivators now control a small world projection, in which they can
    teleport at will and lock down opponents in a spatial cage.</li>
    <li><strong>Law Stitching</strong> - Expand your law runes into a law tapestry. Meddle with the laws of the natural world.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Body Cultivation</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Body Strengthening</strong> - Body cultivators start off by performing a basic strengthening of their body, purifying it in the process. Typically,
    the body is nourished with qi and then refined with an opposing qi, removing any impurities.</li>
    <li><strong>Bone Forging</strong> - After sufficiently strengthening their body, body cultivators must forge their bones to further support their growth.
    Bones are the basis of strength and durability. They traditionally subject their bones to intense quantities of qi,
    strengthening and tempering them in the process. They become akin to magic treasures, making it extremely difficult to
    shatter them using strength of an equivalent realm. Bone-forging cultivators gain the ability to manipulate their weight
    by using voids that are formed in their bones, making it easier to wield heavy weapons and use their immense strength to
    their advantage.</li>
    <li><strong>Marrow Refining</strong> - Once the bones are strong enough, it is necessary for cultivators to refine their marrow. Marrow is the basis of their
    blood, which feeds the remainder of their body in turn. Marrow-refining cultivators gain powerful regeneration abilities
    stemming from the deep pool of vitality hidden within their marrow and the voids in their bones.</li>
    <li><strong>Blood Awakening</strong> - Demigods awaken the divinity in their blood. By exhausting their stored divine power, they can use divine abilities. The
    heavens respect demigods, so they gain certain innate resistances to elements.</li>
    <li><strong>Muscle Empowering</strong> - Muscles are suffused with divine power and grant a demi-god the ability to transcend mortal strength limitations.</li>
    <li><strong>Shell Marking</strong> - A demigod marks his inner world's boundary with runes of protection. These same runes are engraved on his skin, and form
    a protective divine shell.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Demon Cultivation</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Demonification</strong> - Spirit beasts are products of nature. By gaining demonic qi from their natural surroundings, they grow in power. If
    their bloodline is sufficiently potent, they can break through and become demon beasts.</li>
    <li><strong>Purification</strong> - Bloodline purity is essential for a demon's advancement. Demons in the purification realm continuously purify their
    bloodline with demonic energy they gain by either consuming other demons, humans, or natural treasures. They can also do
    this by living on a demonic mountain, but the process is much slower. Demons who possess sufficiently pure and potent
    bloodlines can awaken ancestral memories.</li>
    <li><strong>Core Formation</strong> - When a demon's bloodline is sufficiently pure, it can be crystalized into a demonic core. By feeding this core with
    demonic energy, a demon grows stronger. Core-formation demons can fly.</li>
    <li><strong>Initiation</strong> - Gain the acknowledgment of your demonic alignment and create your demon weapon. Fight for the glory of your faction!
    Demons collect demonic energy via consumption and quests. They exert power over natural energies in their dominions.
    Initiation Realm demons have strong bodies and powerful natural weapons. They are strengthened and weakened by their
    surroundings. Being part of nature, demons must continuously consume, or their strength will waste away.</li>
    <li><strong>Investiture</strong> - A demon's alignment further invests in their champion and bestows upon them a set of demon armor. Investiture realm
    demons are better, faster, and stronger. Also, they can now invest nature, changing the very terrain to better suit them
    and their faction.</li>
    <li><strong>Fusion</strong> - Upon reaching the fusion realm, a demon must fuse with the land and rejoin with their manifestation. They are able to
    adopt their bestial war form, or 'fusion transformation' state, for a short time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Terminology</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Daoists</strong> - Title given to Rune Carving cultivators.</li>
    <li><strong>Dao God</strong> - Daoist who is a Demigod.</li>
    <li><strong>Dao Lord</strong> - Daoists who overcome difficult feats in cultivation.</li>
</ul>
