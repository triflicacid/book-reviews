<h1>Review</h1>
<p>The storyline of Greg being Aether reborn is an exciting idea and is fun to watch play out. However, while the writing is good, the story is extremely slow. Dialogue could easily be cut down by a third at least. I do not need to know how the group spend their days in detail, every day, especially when it is repetitive most of the time. Furthermore, Greg and the others are barely adults having just had their ritual, and yet they speak and act like seasoned parents and in a way unnatural for casual conversation. The series started as a semi-progression, epic fantasy about a gods return to overthrow an empire, but is turning into a day-to-day recounting of a teenage mage who is building a harem of furries with unecessary explicit sex scenes while every other woman seems to pine for him and blush at every turn. On a good note, when he decides to write action such as tournaments, it is pretty engaging.</p>
<p>Excellent potential, book 1 introduced an epic idea and an interesting system, just for the book to slow down to a snail's pace and the adventure, magic plot taking a backseat for a furry harem smut book, making me feel like the magic system was created just make Gregory important in order to facilitate him gaining a harem.  Disappointed.</p>

<h1>Magic System</h1>
<p>Wielders of magic, called magic, are few and far-between, with rituals being held where they are tested to see if they harbour a flame of aether. If so, they are magi and are sent to the Academy to train to serve and protect the empire.
<br>There exist three paths for a magic to follow. Following two is rare and often ends in failure.
<br><ul>
    <li><strong>Path of the Body</strong> - this path focuses on channeling aether around the body, providing physical enhacements.</li>
    <li><strong>Path of the Mind</strong> - this path focuses on using aether to sharpen the mind, increasing problem solving skills and processing.</li>
    <li><strong>Path of the Spirit</strong> - this path focuses on connecting to and becoming one with your aether, extending it to feel those around you and strengthen your aether itself, making it burn cleaner and become more efficient.</li>
</ul>
<br>Besides a path, which the magic chooses, every magic has one addinity, which dictates what magic they can do. Affinities can include earth, fire, metal, spatial, and shadow. A magic can wield dual affinities, but both are either weaker than a full affinity, or one is almost useless while theother is like a normal full-affinity.
<br>Magis consume aether-infused foods to gain aether, but such foods must be measured to match the ranks of the magi consuming it to not overwhelm them, and the food must be tempered with non-aether-infused foods to control the aether flame.
</p>

<h1>Ranks</h1>
<p>While not a progression fantasy, magi's do have ranks which is indicated by the colour of their kimono and by a medallion around their necks. Advancement is triggered by training one's Path and affinity. Advacement by a tier highlights another coloured circle on their medallion, while advancement by rank changes the colour of the medallion's circles.</p>
