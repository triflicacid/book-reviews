<strong>NOTE</strong> This series is being written on Royal Road; I have read chapters there that have not yet been published, up to volume 9.

<h1>Review</h1>
Like Dragon Heart, this series focuses more on the personal impact and toll of cultivation and slaughter.
This series has a nice slice-of-life style to it, but it sufficiently paced to not be tedious.
With instances of politicing, noble house and sect thrashing and building, this is an exciting read.

<h1>Progression</h1>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Qi-condensing</strong> &mdash; gather Qi in dantian and expand meridians.</li>
    <li><strong>Foundation formation</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Core formation</strong> &mdash; construct core.</li>
    <li><strong>Nascent soul</strong> &mdash; awakening of ones soul.</li>
</ul>

Once at peak nascent soul, the Heaven's forces a cultivator to ascend.
The nature of ascension is not known; most believe it is a rise to godhood, but others such as Sen believe that they will rise to a greater plane, and start the entire journey over as they become the weakest in the plane.
