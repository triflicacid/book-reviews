<h2>Review</h2>
<p>A thrilling story full of adventure and twists. Each main character has a distinct personality and is wholly likeable, with traits of their respective eldrin either accompanying or balancing their arcanists' personality. Great world building and descriptions, with an awesom ending fit for the story.</p>

<h2>Magic System</h2>
<p>People have the ability to perform magic, but this power cannot be unlocked lest the person bonds with a mythical creature. In order to bond the person must complete that creature's trial of worth, a test which varies from creature to creature. Once completed, the creature will offer to bond. Once bonded, the creature becomes known as an eldrin and the person an arcanist.</p>
<p>The magic one gains is dependent on their eldrin. Every arcanist has one ability from each of the following fields:<br><ul>
    <li><strong>Evocation</strong> - when one creates something with one's magic e.g. lightning</li>
    <li><strong>Manipulation</strong> - when one controls tthe elements associated with one's aldrin e.g. creating storms</li>
    <li><strong>Augmentation</strong> - when one alters something with one's magic, either oneself or an object e.g. flying</li>
    <li><strong>Aura</strong> - when one spreads their magic into the surrounding environment e.g. healing aura</li>
</ul><br>
Star shards are chunks of magic fallen from the heavens which started in the first coming of an age. Using star shards, one may imbue their magic into items to give them an associated ability. Items which used less than 10 star shards during imbuing are known as trinkets, 10 or more are known as artifacts.
<br>A special stone known as nullstone has the ability to prevent magic being used. It may be refined and attuned to block/allow specific types of magic. From this, the Second Ascension created decay dust which has the ability to destroy any trinket it comes in contact with.</p>
