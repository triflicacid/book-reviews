<h2>Review</h2>
<p><em>Book series is in progress.</em></p>

<h2>Magic System</h2>
<p>Most people are born with a core (5/6). A core can hold essence, and later Qi, Chakra and Reiki. Early on in advancement ther burn channels throughout the body to channel essence, and form pattern around their core for cycling and purification of essence.</p>
<p>In the Trial of beggining one faces trials for the 8 core paths. Often one will be called to a certain path or multiple. Each artist takes on the characters of the path and create techniques around its element.<br>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Path of Earth</strong> - slow but strong.</li>
    <li><strong>Path of Water</strong> - nimble and flowing.</li>
    <li><strong>Path of Fire</strong> - ferocious and wild.</li>
    <li><strong>Path of Air</strong> - quick.</li>
    <li><strong>Path of Lightness</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Path of Darkness</strong> - sneaky and silent.</li>
    <li><strong>Path of Weakness</strong> - sleaky and slimy.</li>
    <li><strong>Path of Power</strong> - blunt and strong.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Beats are animals with cores. Cores may be removed from beasts and cycled, though the power gained is much less than the level of the core.</p>
<p>There are four different types of energy, each of which is unlocked at a certain belt. The belt before this they can sense and make the new energy type, but not use it without being destroyed (potentially):<br>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Essence</strong> - a gaseous-like substance.</li>
    <li><strong>Qi</strong> - a watery-like substance. 1/25 as powerul as Essence.</li>
    <li><strong>Chakra</strong> - a syrupy-like substance. 1/100 as powerful as Essence.</li>
    <li><strong>Reiki</strong> - an almost-solid substance. 1/1000 as powerful as Essence.</li>
    <li><strong>Soulcore</strong> - ??. 1/?? as powerful as Essence.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Techniques</h3>
<p>All martial artists will train in techniques over the course of their Path. There are nine overall techniques, which can be broken into 2 categories, and each of which can be improved 5 times in potency and cost.</p>
<p><strong>Body Techniques</strong> - control of the physical self.<br>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Physical</strong> - affects the body directly, strengthening blows or lending one special properties. The user must make physical contact for the technique to work.</li>
    <li><strong>Movement</strong> - affects how the body moves, increasing speed, flexibility, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Armorer</strong> - affects how the body stands up to damage. The more damage taken, the more energy used.</li>
    <li><strong>Full-body</strong> - a combination of the previous 3 techniques, multiplying their effect many times.</li>
</ul></p>
<p><strong>Spirit Techniques</strong> - control of energy.<br>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Projected</strong> - projects energy outward as an attack. Mostly used as ranged attacks but can be used to enhance physical techniques. Requires a lot of concentration.</li>
    <li><strong>Terrain</strong> - controls energy outside the body to affect the terrain using theit will.</li>
    <li><strong>Containment</strong> - used to capture someone or contain attacks. Needs extreme control and is slow to form.</li>
    <li><strong>Full-area</strong> - a combination of the previous 3 techniques, multiplying their effect many times.</li>
</ul></p>
<p><strong>Conqueror</strong> - a combination of full-body and full-area techniques, lends full control over body and spirit.</p>

<h2>Progression</h2>
<p>As the book is centred on the martial arts, ranking is done through belts. Belts the,selves are manifestations of the core. Cores can be veriled to hide ones presence to the spirit sense, or their core restricted to a lower belt, but otherwise a belt cannot be faked. To advance a Dan one must push the boundaries of ones core with the respective energy type. Once the maximum Dans have been reached, a Torii gate will appear. To advance to the next belt, one must enter and complete a test or which only 3 attempts are given.</p>
