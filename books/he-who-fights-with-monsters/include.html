<h2>Progression</h2>
<p>Progression is split into ranks, with each rank progressively harder to reach. One levels up by levelling up all their abilities. This is commonly done through exercising them (fighting similar-rank monsters) or consuming monster cores (but this method hhits a wall at gold).</p>
<ul>

    <li><strong>Bronze</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Silver</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Gold</strong></li>

</ul>
