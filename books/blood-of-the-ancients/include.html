<h2>Review</h2>
<p>This series has a well-constructed magic system and expansive world. It is a shame that this is not explored as much as it could be. While I would like to hear out the story, the writing and dialogue are tedious and repetitive, not to mention littered with grammar and spelling mistakes. I could literally skip pages of dialogue and not learn anything new. I had to give up as reading took effort to do, something which is not good for any series, and while I initially stuck through the first book and half of the second to explore the story the quality and repetiveness of writing forced me to quit.</p>

<h2>Magic System</h2>
<p><u>Disclaimer</u>: this is a limited overview of what I have learnt up to mid-way through book 2.</p>
<p>Initially, Rob's people believe that essence (or fire water, as they call it) is a mixture of dragon blood from ancient dragons who died eons ago, and water. It turns out that firewater is stone essence, a type of essence of which there are many. Consuming essence increases your capabilities and strength in magics relating to the essence type.</p>

<h2>Progression</h2>
<p>At the point of reading, the known stages of progression are: Dragon Forged, Dragon Skin, Dragon Touched, Dragon Heart, Dragon Mind, and Dragon Soul. With each stage of progression, one gains further power and proficiency over ones essence(s). With each stage, one further embodies a dragon and, when advanced enough, one becomes a dragon.</p>

<h2>Main Characters</h2>
