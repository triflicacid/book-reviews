<h1>Magic System</h1>
<p>The magic is based around the 12 affinities. Everyone has a certain affinity for each affinities, measured between 0 and 100%. For an affinity to be considered "awakened" (to be practiced, used and developed) it must be in excess of 20%.</p>
<p><ul>
    <li><strong>Light</strong> - Allows the practitioner to control the presence of radiance; involves creating illusions and enhancing perception, as
    well as destructive focused light beams.</li>
    <li><strong>Dark</strong> - Allows the practitioner to control darkness or void; involves spatial manipulation for creating teleportation arrays and
    void storage devices; enables stealth and destructive annihilation of matter.</li>
    <li><strong>Life</strong> - Allows the practitioner to control life energy; grants perception of vital energy in living things and the ability to
    manipulate living tissue/plant matter by generating growth.</li>
    <li><strong>Death</strong> - Allows the practitioner to control death energy; grants perception of vital energy in living things and the ability to
    manipulate living tissue/plant matter by causing decay and destruction. Allows manipulation of souls, but the practice
    is outlawed globally, and the knowledge largely lost.</li>
    <li><strong>Mountain</strong> - Allows the practitioner to control properties of physical matter, such as hardness or softness and friction coefficient;
    most Mountain practitioners are also earth elementalists, with the power to shape earth at will.</li>
    <li><strong>Cloud</strong> - Allows the practitioner to control properties of gases on a large scale, often to affect phenomena like weather; most
    Cloud practitioners are also wind elementalists, with the power to manipulate air at will.</li>
    <li><strong>Sun</strong> - Allows the practitioner to control heat and nurture plant life, often for agricultural purposes; most Sun practitioners
    are also fire elementalists, with the power to manifest and control fire at will.</li>
    <li><strong>Moon</strong> - Allows the practitioner to control cold and enhance tidal forces between objects; used by the most powerful individuals,
    it can induce an artificial gravitational effect. Most Moon practitioners are also water elementalists, with the power
    to shape water at will.</li>
    <li><strong>Beginning</strong> - Augments the practitioner's perception and mental processing ability, allowing them to pick up on patterns and crunch
    probabilities rapidly in real time. A constant stream of observations influences the practitioner's understanding about
    the past and predictions of the future. Enhances reflexes and coordination.</li>
    <li><strong>End</strong> - Allows the practitioner to see arrows of fate and control an End avatar (also known as an ethereal body) to create
    binding oaths and multi-functional arrays.</li>
    <li><strong>Regret</strong> - Allows the practitioner to create scenarios that branch off from a current moment in reality, effectively seeing into
    the future. Upon a scenario's end, they return to the present. The most powerful Regret practitioners can make tens of
    scenarios per second and simulate time forward for up to a minute.</li>
    <li><strong>Remorse</strong> - Allows the practitioner to affect the minds of others in a variety of ways, such as for attacking people by ensorceling
    them in mental illusions. Has numerous non-combat purposes like psychological healing and memory extraction.</li>
</ul>
<br>There are also elementalists, which specialise in the manipulation of a given element: wind, earth, fire, or water.</p>
<p>Once a practitioner reaches sufficient power the may ascend. An ascension is accompanied by a descendant, who will often wreak havoc in a localised area before leaving/. As such, ascendants are often hunted and killed as killing them will cancel the descendant. Ascendants are able to live in Eternity, which is an endless collection of planes. Ascendants may also use and manipulate Ascendant Energy which may be used to cut through planes, fly and cancel other energies, etc.</p>
