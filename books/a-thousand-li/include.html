<h1>Review</h1>
<p>This is a slice-of-life style series that follows young cultivator Wu Ying through his journey to get stronger. As such, this book is rather slow-paced. The writing and content themselves are excellent, with the author's research and immersion in Chinese culture shining throughout the books, but is ultimatley too ploddy and lacking any real goal or action for my liking. As this tier list is on my overall enthralment and engagement with a series, and not objective on the book itself, it scores average; it is not boring, but doesn't make me want to read more.</p>

<h1>Magic System</h1>
<p>Cultivators are those able and skilled enought to absorb and cycles essence from their surroundings through their cores. In the Body Cleansing stage, a cultivator unblocks their meridians which allow essence to flow around their body. In later stages, they create an energy store and core within themselves able to hold essence, granting them the ability to project essence rather than simply use it to strengthen the body.</p>
<p>Everyone has a Dao which they hunt for during their cultivation journey, which at later stages is vital the the future of their path and what magic they can perform.</p>

He helps save their men by spotting an attempted sneak-attack on the camp. This earns a notice from an Elder of the Verdant Green Waters sect, to which he is recruited. Unlike many other series in this tier list, Wu Ying is not particularly gifted and does not posess any skill ot ability which marks him out; rather, he is a standard, but relatable, man with a drive to learn and progress.</li>
    <li><strong>Tou He</strong> - an ex-monk who becomes Wu Ying's friend. Tou is gifted and finds progressing and fighting easy, but is rather laid-back much to the chagrin of Wu.</li>
