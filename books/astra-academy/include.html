<h1>Review</h1>
Much like Stovall's other work, The Frith Chronicles, this series is full of adventure. Each character has a distinct personality that mesh well together. Again, worldbuilding is a real highlight with great care given to describing and brining together the surroundings.

<h1>Characters</h1>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Gray Lexly</strong> - the main character, the younger Lexly twin with bizarre gray eyes. He is the son of a candlemaker, his mother passing away at birth. He has violent nightmares were monsters try to kill him. Professor Helmith of Astra Academy visits and protects him in these dreams. It is because of her that he wants to become an arcanist; he and Sorin trick some Unicorns into bonding with them, but tell them the truth and decline at the last moment. He and his brother then travel to Astra Academy, where Gray bonds with a mimic, Twain, and Sorin with a knightmare, Thurin. Gray discovers that there is an imposter disguised as Professor Helmith and uncoves a lot to open a portal to the Abyssal Hells, which he and others manage to stop. When the gate is destroyed its fragments explode far and wide. It is discovered that Gray's presence seems to trigger these fragments and spawn monsters from the Abyssal Hells. He touches one of these and it absorbs into him. It turns out that Death Lors Deimos is astrally projecting himself through these fragments and, through the absorption, is able to take control of Gray's body. When fighting Professor Helmith, however, Gray is able to take back some control allowing the Professor to lock Deimos away in a state of permanent slumber. A few weeks later, Gray ends up voluntarily allowing Deimos to partially control him to help escape a kidnapping of him and his family - through thie bond, he is able to recall Deimos' memories and skills.
