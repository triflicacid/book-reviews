<h2>Review</h2>
<p><em>Book series is in progress.</em></p>

<h2>Magic System</h2>
<p>Everyone is born with the ability to manifest a core. Once manifested, the core stored essence. Essence can be of various types, such as breath or fire, and is cultivated (regenerated) depending on its type. People with cores are called surgecallers thanks to their ability to surge essence, which is essentially using the essence e.g. moving faster than normal, creating fire. People may have their cores removed, wherein they become surgeless, sometimes called nulls, soulless, or empty.</p>
<p>Beasts can have cores as well, and different beasts have different unique essences, aside from the physical and elemental essences. Once Knighthood is achieved, one may harvest and cultivate these essences. Unlike humans, beasts advance their surges instead of their body, so it is possible for a beast to have Legendary-level speed but only Knight-level venom. There is a method of speedy advancement by absorbing beast essences to quickly reach the core's limits, but this results in the human gaining animal-like traits.</p>
<p>Below are listed some important techniques mentioned and used throughout the series:<br><ul>
    <li><strong>Cultivating</strong> - this is the method by which essence may be regenerated. The physical essences are cultivated via training and can be cultivates all the time, while other essences require acts similar to their nature e.g. for earth essence, one must be near rock/soil, for sharpness essence one must sharpen an object.</li>
    <li><strong>Outward State</strong> - this state allows for the surgecaller to give someone else their essence, for example giving stamina essence to heal someone.</li>
    <li><strong>Receptive State</strong> - this state allows for one to feel for essences around them. This is used at Squire-level to gain access to the elemental surges.</li>
    <li><strong>Communing with the Universe</strong> - a state of meditation in which one projects their thoughts and will into the Universe. This is used to project one's intentions and advance to Knight, and is used by Huon to summon and communicate to the Devil of the West.</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Progression</h2>
<p>Progression is achieved through reaching the limits of one's current level. Advancement is then triggered, enlarging one's core among other things and increasing the natural strength of one's body and senses as well as prolonging lifespan.</p>

When Huon, when bound to the Immortal of Fire, attack the resistance's lake lair, Houn and Bern fight. Huon, fighting the bond with his will, spares Bern and so remains bound.

</ul></p>

<h2>Enemies</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The Everlasting King is the surgeless ruler of (initially) five realms, the oathmaster of seven Immortals. Surgecallers are but slaves in his realm, a fact Huon wished to change. The Devil of the West reveals to him that the king is lying about his past, that his kind were subjugated until the king fought and in turn subjugates surgecallers, and was in fact once a High Celestial who was stripped of his core by other celestials. He resorted to stripping cores from his citiens to build himself back up.</li>
</ul>
