<h2>Magic System</h2>
<p><u>Disclaimer</u>: magical theory is widely debated by the peoples in this series, with theories such as attunements being vertices in a graph. This section will only cover the system briefly and will not go that far into the details.</p>
<p>A person is born with a certain amount of mana reservoirs, normally between 2-4. Mana is abosrbed into one's reservoirs from the aether, which is a see of magical essence in the world (it is revealed that aether is the by-product of the Universe dying, but that is not relevent here). Absorbed mana is attuned in each reservoir and can be used in different ways. The most common way of using mana is by directing it into spellforms, which is like a language describing what the essence should do. Spellforms must be envisioned in the minds eye - the bigger the mind's eye, the more powerful spells may be cast/spells may be cast in parallel. There are plenty of well-known spellforms which are often memorised, but the most versatile mages are able to construct custom spellforms on the fly (however this can be dangerous if one is not absolutely certain and capable).</p>
<p>The main character, Hugh, is a warlock, meaning that he can pact to other beings. Pacted partners gain access to eachothers affinities and are able to sense eachother through a bond.</p>
<p>Affinities vary widely, from broad affinities such as fire to niche affinities such as oak trees. The nature of how affinities develop is theorised in the book, but it is known that affinities vary culture to culture and are seemingly influenced by one's environment. The more niche the effinity, the greater control over that thing one has. One can create artificial mana reservoirs, but it is an act which requires great time and skill.</p>

<h2>Progression</h2>
<p>Mage Errant is not a progression fantasy so does not have a clear ranking system. However, there are a few titles mentioned throughout.</p>
<table class="fancy">
    <tr>
        <th>Mind-blind</th>
        <td>Named due to their apparent lack of the ability to picture spellforms in their mind, mind-blind are magic-less peoples who are often used as servants and as canon-fodder in battles.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Battlemage</th>
        <td>Battle mages are mages specialsed in combat magic and are valuable to an army's ranks</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Siege mages</th>
        <td>Siege mages specialise in siege magic which involves expending their entire mana reserve in a single powerful spell. Due to their one-use (at least, in a reasonable time frame) they are often used as the opening volley in a battle, or during sieges to assault the enemy standpoint.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Archmage</th>
        <td>Archmages are powerful mages which are so advanced as to have created their own techniques and/or spells.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Great Powers</th>
        <td>Great powers are superior to archmages and able to do great thing, such as defeat armies solo, create cities and the like. To achieve this rank, one must kill a great power or have another great power call you as such. The league of great powers is not linear and contains a wide variety of ability and power.</td>
    </tr>

<p>Mage Errant is a series in the world of the Aetheriad. As such, there are mentions of other ranks such as Named. However these are not explored in much detail in this series, so are not listed.</p>

<h2>Main Characters</h2>
<ul>
    <li><em>Hugh Stormward (of Emblin)</em> - Outcast from his magic-fearing aether thin homeland, Emblin, Hugh struggles with magic. A librarian called Alustin takes him and the next two characters under his wing. Turns out, he's a warlock and is failing at magic because he is overloading the spellforms. Due to his warlock status, he imbues will naturally into his wards, and is thus (relatively) skilled at wardcrafting - constructing a ward around Lothal was how he earned his name. He bonds with Kanderon Crux while in the labyrinth, thinking he was bonding to the sentient library (the Index). He gains crystal, star fire and planar affinities from her and begins training. He eventually ends up bonding with Talia, Sabae and Godrick in a four-way warlock pact to become powerful and help Coven defeat Havath and Alustin.</li>
    <li><em>Talia of Clan Castis</em> - Taelia was sent to Skyhold due to her problems with magic - being born into a strong fire clan, she was marked with focusing tattoos when young. When she did not manifest a fire affinity she was ashamed, and her tattoos made using other kind of magic extremely difficult. Due to her dream reservoir leaking into her bone reservoir she masterd unique bone magic which allowed her to expand and explode bones. She is slightly obsessive over weapons and violence, but this pales in contrast to her brothers.</li>
    <li><em>Sabae Kaen Das</em> - Granddaughter of Ilinia Kaen Das, the matriarch of the Kaen Das family and a great power, she was expected to be a powerful lightning mage. However, she has difficulty casting spells at any distance from her being so was sent to Skyhold so others could attempt to aid her. She eventually learns to control her lightning affinity, but also has wind and healing affinities. She doesn't initially use her healing affinity due to shame.</li>
    <li><em>Godrick Hammerbreaker</em> - son of Artur Wallbreaker, an archmage known for his stone armour, joins the main characaters not long after they meet Alustin. On top of a stone affinity, Godrick also posses steel and scent. He is given the name Hammerbreaker as he broke several of his previous hammers to escape dire situations via the subsequent explosion from enchantments.</li>
    <li><em>Mackerel</em> - Mackerel is a sentient green spellbook created from attuning an Aether crystal which attached itself to a labyrinth stone. He is a powerful companion and helps them navigate labyrinths and create a bubble ehere they can't be scryed on. He is known for his humerous and troublesom antics, and unique topological view of the world.</li>
    <li><em>Kanderon Krux</em> - A giant crystal sphinx, she is one of the most powerful Great Powers on Ithos. She heads the Librarians Errant, a team of special agents to spy on and infiltrate enemy states. She is the founder of and most powerful member on the Skyhold Council.</li>
    <li><em>Alustin Haber</em> - lead Librarian Errant, he takes in Hugh, Talia and Sabae as they are all unusual in the magical aspect, and uses his knowledge and expertise to help train them into formidable mages. He is one of the last citizens of Helicote and wishes their destroyer, Havath, to suffer. While this revenge drives him to abhorent actions, including harming Hugh, he is an intelligent, practical man at heart so stops when he realises the true devestating potential of his actions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Main Enemy</h2>
<p>For the first few books, the primary enemy was a demon known as Bakori who resided in Skyhold's labyrinth. Having been defeated by Kanderon previously, he wished to pact with Hugh in order to escape. After that, the Havathi Dominion were the main protagonists, leading the siege of Skyhold. In his mission for vengeance, Alustin and the Librarians Errant became a foe, but Alustin eventually changed him mind after destroying Havath city before releasing the Tongue Eater and worked with the Coven to take down the remaining Havathi forces and Heliothrax.</p>
