<h1>Review</h1>
Unlike some other cultivation stories, this series delves into the humanity and "honor" in the cultivation world.
Hadjar fights for a new chance whe he is reborn, only for that to come crumbling down. This is a story of firm resolve. and he develops as he become smore powerful and matures with interesting commentds on honor and percieved worth.
One interesting aspect is the isekai; at the beginning, it seems like a normal isekai novel. However, increasingly throughout, the mention of this City becomes more and more real. When other characters mention this City, it raises the interesting question of its existance and location in this world.

<h1>Progression</h1>
There are many aspects to power. The "normal" method is via world energy, with stages outlines below.
Later in the story, Hadjar realises that world energy is almost like a parasite, so forgoes it and focuses on "self-energy" Therna.
Using it, he is able to easily overpower and default world-energy wielding cultivaors. Note, the first two stages are still considered mortal.
