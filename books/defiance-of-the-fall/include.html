<strong>NOTE</strong> This series is being written on Royal Road; I have read chapters there that have not yet been published.

<h1>Review</h1>
The series starts of superbly, with Zac all on his own, fighting to survive and understand the new way of the world after integration. This continues into alliance-building as he stabalises the new Earth and its various factions and governments.
However, his progress in cultivation after the first few books slows dramatically. This is understandable as difficulty increases, but it is painfully slow later on. The author focuses on world building, which is fantastic, but there is simply <em>too much</em>.
Zac is always dragged into one thing after another, with difficulties keeping track of names, clans, etc. Also, at this pace, the series will be around 40 books long!

<h1>Progression</h1>
Progression is ultimately centred around levels, with a new major stage breached every 75 levels, and a minor every 25 levels.
