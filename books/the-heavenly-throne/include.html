<h1>Magic System</h1>
<p>The magic system is rather in-depth compared to other books. In System oversees the Ecumene, assisting beings in cultivation. In overview: the cultivator has stats, which parametrise one's strengths, Once can own and master both elements and concepts which can be used in techniques.<br>
Reality can be thought of as split into three layers:<br><ul>
    <li>Material Layer - may be influenced by energy.</li>
    <li>Spiritual Layer - may be perceived by spiritual perception. This layer houses spirits, which are dence clusters of sentient particles, and sylphs. Spirit contracts are formed through this layer, the breaching of which attacks one's soul.</li>
    <li>Informational Layer - contains the information of things, the re-writing of which changes reality. May only be perceived by divine will. System oaths work on this layer, the breaching of which are much more severe and are much harder to break.</li>
</ul>
On a deeper level, everything is constructed of tiny strings which vibrate. With enough vibrations, matter is created, as can energy. Vibrations from hyper-strings convery the laws of the universe and govern reality. To fully master will, one must harness the will of the spark and vibrate strings themselves.</p>
<h2>Energy</h2>
<p>Energy is a spiritual substance that allows sentient beings to influence and shape reality through weaving techniques. Energy may be free, meaning that it isn't bound to matter or compressed into crystals. Energy exists in all living beings, but only those with an awakened warrior soul layer can manipulate it. Prana is external energy, while ki is internal energy. Energy exists in regions of higher or lower density, as it flows in lines throughout Ecumene. Peripheral worlds have little energy, middle worlds have a moderate amount, and central worlds havean abundance, as the energy lines converge to the Ecumene's centre.</p>
<h3>Paths</h3>
<p>A Path references the particular Forces of a given element (e.g. the Path of Sword, the Path of Space). Concepts are Paths which are but an immitation of a Higher Force:
    <ul>
        <li>Cold Void - concept of the Higher Force of Decceleration.</li>
        <li>Heat Void - concept of the Higher Force of Acceleration.</li>
        <li>Radiant Void - concept of the Higher Force of Reversal.</li>
        <li>Yin - concept of the Higher Force of Destruction.</li>
        <li>Yang - concept of the Higher Force of Creation.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>Elements</h3>
<p>Cultivators may observe manifestations of various elements through meditation in order to grasp the essence of said elements. The stronger and more thorough the understanding, the stronger one can use the elements by manipulating Force particles (will-imbued element particles).
<ul>
    <li>Hearing Stage - understanding of the Forces of the element.</li>
    <li>Seer Stage - mastering of the Force of Form.</li>
    <li>Learner Stage - mastering of the Force of Fusion by combining the previous Forces then merging them with one's soul, body and mind.</li>
    <li>Walker Stage - analysis of details and awareness of the construction of the Force of Fusion allows the creation of Spheres.</li>
    <li>Perfect Understanding - further understanding allows the creation of Advanced Spheres.</li>
    <li>Beyond Perfect Understanding - cannot be made by a soul which has made a breakthrough in an ATS, available only to deities.</li>
</ul></p>
<h3>Spheres</h3>
<p>A Sphere is an area of space saturated with one's will which acts as a carrier of their element. The presence of a Sphere allows their attacks to dominate over others and weaken their enemies.</p>
<h2>Rank</h2>
<p>Any technique, artifact or alchemical concoction has a rank.
    <ul>
        <li>Low - simplest energy manipulation.</li>
        <li>Earth - simplest weaves of energy.</li>
        <li>Silver - complex weaves suplemented by incomplete or partial knowledge of a fundamental Force.</li>
        <li>Gold - weavings based on all the Forces of one Path. The Force of Form gives peak-level gold rank.</li>
        <li>Royal - weavings based on the Force of Fusion.</li>
        <li>Imperial - weavings based on the Walker stage.</li>
        <li>Pseudo-Divine - weavings based on elements at the Perfect Stage sans an Advanced Sphere.</li>
        <li>Divine - weavings based on elements at the Perfect Stage with an Advanced Sphere.</li>
        <li>Heavenly - weavings based on elements at the Beyond Perfect Stage.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>The Soul</h2>
<p>The soul is fundamental to any living being, consisting of three parts:<ul>
    <li>Spark - the core, it is eternal and indestructable with its own will. The Spark may evolve, increasing one's will. Once the vessel dies, the spark returns to the worl of the dead, is cleansed, and is then reincarnated.</li>
    <li>Soul Energy - the sou's primary resource spent on the soul shell. It may also be utilised through techniques. Soul energy feeds one's lifespan, so this is dangerous. This energy may be replenished with divine power, consuming soul spirit fruits, or the combination of both Yin and Yang into the spark.</li>
    <li>Soul Shell - the sphere surrounding the soul that performs all spiritual abilities. The Mental layer is responsible for intellectual abilities; the Emotial layer is responsible for emotions; the Warrior layer is responsible for basic abilities such as ki and aura manipulation. The quality of the shell depends on the quality of breakthroughs past the Mind stage. Sub-layers may form between the main layers which increase transmission between them. Each sub-layer corresponds to 0.25 Master Stars. The Master Star test determines a cultivator's strength in this regard, testing them against difficult oponents to determine which layers they use. The rating ranges from Fesat, One Small Star, One Average Star, One Large Star, Two Small Stars etc. all the way to Seven Large Stars. Eight Stars is through to be impossible, only achieved by few divine beings. An artificual Seven Great Stars title was created to account for those above Seven Large Stars.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>One's soul may contain certain manifestations.<ul>
    <li>Ability to create parallel streams of consciousness.</li>
    <li>Increased ki recovery rate.</li>
    <li>Increased rate of ki release.</li>
    <li>Easier control of Particles and ki.</li>
    <li>Increased spirit stamina and/or perception.</li>
    <li>Improved memory and/or concentration.</li>
    <li>Perfect Soul - increased spiritual perception, heals soul injuries, restores soul energy.</li>
    <li>Supreme Stimulation - the ability to create and accumulate information and trigger Enlightenment based on it.</li>
    <li>Spirit Memory - almost perfect memory.</li>
    <li>Utilmate Focus - allow the increase of the owners level of concentration at will.</li>
    <li>Cover Expansion - allows the cultivator to temporarily strengthen their cover into a barrier.</li>
    <li>Untamable Stream - allows the ability to release any amount of soul energy.</li>
    <li>Renewal - allows the cultibator to restore their spirit endurance reserves.</li>
    <li>Restoration - allows the cultivator to restore their entire supply of energy.</li>
    <li>Surveillance Zone - enhances and expends the area of spiritual perception.</li>
    <li>Sudden Suppression - allows one to emit their aura and immobilise anyone it touches.</li>
</ul></p>
<h2>Will</h2>
<p>Every living thing has a desire to continue living - that is will. The Universe itself has will which permeates everything. A beings spark can develop its own will which may be used by its owner, albeit with resistance from the Universe.<br>
<ul>
    <li>Master's Will - the primary ability to control will which is available to all True Masters.</li>
    <li>Field of Superiority - expends the telekinetic and mind controlling aspect of the Master's Will in an area surrounding the cultivator.</li>
    <li>Desolation of the Weak - allows the cultivator to steal energy from a beaing of weaker will.</li>
    <li>Complete Submission - allows the cultivator to move and manipulate objects in a field, such increasing one's strength and enhance and dispel techniques.</li>
    <li>Look of the Lord - greatly increases the subjugating aspect of Master's Will.</li>
    <li>Elemental Will - allows one to use the elements in the absence of energy, Force particles and techniques.</li>
</ul></p>

<h1>Progression</h1>
<p>Progression between stages is difficult, more than an accumulation of power. Stages are divides into levels. Other than increased stats, stages may have additional benefits. To break through, the soul shell needs to be prepared by saturating it with energy based on the cultivator's elements, be of a certain quality with a decent foundation (measured 1 to 10, this decreases through each breakthrough unless it is perfect), and have a strong will.</p>
